Cambridgize is a totally pointless package that shuffles the inner letters (all letters except the first and the last) of every word in a text. It was inspired by the famous article stating that, according to a study of the Cambridge University, the order of letters in a word does not matter as long as the first and the last letter are in place. That is because the brain does not read every letter but rather examinates the global shape of the word.
